# many-models
Testing the elegance and execution time of running many models in various languages.

----------

The system I'm running everything on has the following specs:
<dl>
<dd>Processor: i7-4810MQ @ 2.80Ghz</dd>
<dd>RAM: 32 GB</dd>
<dd>OS: Windows 7</dd>
</dl>
I'm not using any GPU or parallel processing to speed things up (that I'm aware of).

Here are the results so far:
